# Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk

## Description
This project focuses on the multi-class prediction of obesity risk in individuals, a factor closely related to cardiovascular diseases. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the analysis is performed on a dataset generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. This project aims to identify and analyze various contributing factors to predict obesity risk accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset includes training and test data, closely mimicking the feature distributions of the original Obesity or CVD risk dataset but generated through deep learning techniques to ensure diversity and complexity in data analysis.
